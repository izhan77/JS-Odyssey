# JavaScript Odyssey
Welcome to my **JavaScript mastery vault**.

This repository is my complete journey of becoming a **JavaScript Engineer** - from fundamentals to advanced concepts. 

Each topic is organized in its own folder with :  
- 📘 **Concept notes** (written in my own words for deep understanding)  
- 💻 **Practice code** (small exercises and examples)  
- 🛠️ **Mini projects** (to apply concepts in real-world scenarios)

My goal with this repo is not just to *learn* JavaScript, but to **master it** - so that even years from now, I can revisit this vault and recall everything with clarity and confidence.

Each folder contains:  
- `README.md` → Topic notes + explanations  
- `.js` files → Code exercises and practice  
- `mini_project.js` → A small project applying the topic

### 🎯 Why this repo?
- To build strong **foundations** in JavaScript  
- To train myself to think like a **JavaScript engineer**  
- To create a **personal reference book** I can use forever  
- To demonstrate my **commitment and growth** as a developer
